$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
	f: A \to B &\iff& f^{-1}: B \to A \\
	f(x) = y &\iff& f^{-1}(y) = x
\end{array}
$$
For any function $f$, each input must have exactly one output. For a function to then have an inverse, each output have exactly one input, meaning that for a function to be inversible, it must be a **one-to-one function** ($\forall a,b\: (a \ne b \implies f(a) \ne f(b))$).

A function is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line intersects its graph more than once: the curve must pass the horizontal and vertical line test.

Geometrically, the inverse of a function gives the curve reflected across the line $y=x$.
