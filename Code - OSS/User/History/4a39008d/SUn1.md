Vectors addition is element-wise and only works for vectors of the same size, just like [[Matrix Addition|with matrices]].
![500|center](vector-addition.excalidraw.svg)
$$\begin{align*}
	\mathbf{\underline{u}} + \mathbf{\underline{v}} &= \vec{AB} + \vec{BC} = \vec{AC} \\
	&= \langle u_1,u_2 \rangle + \langle v_1,v_2 \rangle = \langle u_1 + v_1,u_2 + v_2 \rangle
\end{align*}$$
Note that these vectors/translations can be added/done in any order, meaning vector addition is commutative.
