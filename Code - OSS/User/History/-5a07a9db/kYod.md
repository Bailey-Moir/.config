A function $f$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a set $A$ **exactly one** element, called $f(x)$, in a set $B$; $f: A \to B$.

The **natural domain** of a function is the set of real numbers for which the function gives real values as an output.

So, for example, $y^2 = x$ does not describe a function of $y$, as there are values of $x$ with multiple solutions for $y$, e.g. $x = 1 \implies y = \pm 1$. The **vertical line test** offers a simple way to check viability as a function: a curve in the $xy$- plane is the graph of a function of $x$ if and only if no vertical line intersects the function more than once.
