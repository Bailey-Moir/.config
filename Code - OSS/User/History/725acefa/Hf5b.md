If $f(x) \le g(x) \le h(x)$ when $x$ is near $a$ except possibly at $a$, and $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = \lim_{x\to a} h(x) = L$, then $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a} g(x) = L$. 

This is very similar to [[Comparison Theorem|comparison theorem of improper integrals]] and [[Comparison Theorem for Sequences|comparison theorem for sequences and series]], except this finds a specific value, while those find convergence and divergence.
